This post is intended for college Freshmans those who have little or no experience with Linux. If you are an experienced Linux user you may skip the post safely.

## What is Linux?
Linux is basically a term to refer all the distributions (or say OS) based on Linux Kernel collectively. some of its notable distributions are Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, your favorite Kali Linux.

## Where may you have heard about Kali Linux?
I bet it is your friend or someone elder who said to you that Kali Linux can hack computers. I have seen students being obsessed with this distro without knowing anything about Linux.

Now hack is a stupid term. Most of the people think that it something by which you can access information without proper permission.  No, my friend, the term is much broader.

The **hack** is defined as "a tip, trick, or efficient method for doing or managing something" or in the Indian language, we say *Jugaad*.

## Now, What is Kali Linux?
It is clearly written on their website that Kali Linux is Linux distribution aimed at advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing. Basically. it is a Linux Distro + set of tools.

## Do you need it?
**No**. Because you don't know yet that what is advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing. Just installing the OS will not make you a hacker. It is not a magic wand.

Even if you want to learn Linux it is not a good os to start with, because it is not intended for beginners. Also, it is not intended to be a workstation OS. 
If you really want to learn Linux, go start with Ubuntu, Elementary OS, or Linux Mint. These are easy to setup and the online communities are beginner friendly.

Later on, you can get all those tool sets in Kali Linux in your current Linux OS. And after hopping distro, you will realize that every Linux based OS is same at heart.

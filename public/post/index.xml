      <title>Windows subsystem for Linux is of any use?</title>

&lt;p&gt;I was a long term user of Arch Linux. But recently I decided to switch to  Windows. Why? Because I needed to do some media editing and I heard about WSL which promises a more comfortable life for developers on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I installed a new SSD and started my Windows 10 installation process. Installation went smooth. Then I opened PowerShell to activate the feature and downloaded Ubuntu from the Windows Store.
 Finally, I launched bash and installed &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nodejs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;npm&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;yarn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;python&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;pip&lt;/em&gt;. I was excited to try it all out on Microsoft own Visual Studio Code as it is the only editor which officially supports WSL.

      <title>Prevent roommates/family members from unlocking your android phone with your fingerprint while you are asleep</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today fingerprint scanners are on almost every phone. It is very handy to have a fingerprint sensor to unlock your device. By the time you pull out a phone from your pocket to your eyes it is already unlocked. It also prevents snooping of your password or pattern from behind your shoulders or through a security camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one place where it fails to hide your sensitive chats and photos from your sneaky roommates or a nosy family member. They can easily use your finger to unlock your phone while you are asleep or too high.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to use &#39;xclip in Gnome Wayland&#39;</title>

      <description>Since mainstream launch of Wayland with Gnome, people are facing problem in using xclip. Mainly because xclip is supposed to work with X11 Clipboard.
But fortunately there is an option in xclip to overcome this propblem. Just use xclip -selection c instead of xclip. This option will just emulate the ctrl + shift + c action.
For easier use you can setup the alias by adding following line in .bashrc or .</description>

      <title>Build a Simple WhatsApp bot in Python using Selenium</title>
      <link>https://www.geekyhub.in/post/making-a-whatsapp-bot-using-python-selenium/</link>

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Selenium is a web automation package available for all popular languages. To know more about selenium you can refer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.seleniumhq.org/&#34;&gt;official Selenium docs&lt;/a&gt;.
Here, we will be making a simple WhatsApp bot using Python and Selenium which will reply the current time for every message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-selenium&#34;&gt;Installing Selenium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first of all, we need to install Selenium for Python by running following command in terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;pip install selenium 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selenium also requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. For Firefox, we need to install geckodriver. Without proper driver, you will get &lt;em&gt;WebDriverException&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download latest geckodriver from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases&#34;&gt;Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s GitHub Repo&lt;/a&gt; and add to the path.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some &#39;cool&#39; things Visual Studio Code can do you may haven&#39;t known</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mircosoft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; has proven to be the dark horse of code editors. Don&amp;rsquo;t confuse yourself by seeing Microsoft as it is completely free, open source and MIT licensed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even being late to the party, it has attracted enough users. The reason behind this is a perfect balance between speed, features, and hackability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dear CS Freshman, Kali Linux is not what you are thinking</title>
      <link>https://www.geekyhub.in/post/you-shouldnt-begin-linux-with-kali/</link>

      <guid>https://www.geekyhub.in/post/you-shouldnt-begin-linux-with-kali/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is intended for college Freshmans those who have little or no experience with Linux. If you are an experienced Linux user you may skip the post safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-linux&#34;&gt;What is Linux?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux is basically a term to refer all the distributions (or say OS) based on Linux Kernel collectively. some of its notable distributions are Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, your favorite Kali Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-may-you-have-heard-about-kali-linux&#34;&gt;Where may you have heard about Kali Linux?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet it is your friend or someone elder who said to you that Kali Linux can hack computers. I have seen students being obsessed with this distro without knowing anything about Linux.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Easiest way to become a Hacker&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now hack is a stupid term. Most of the people think that it something by which you can access information without proper permission.  No, my friend, the term is much broader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;hack&lt;/strong&gt; is defined as &amp;ldquo;a tip, trick, or efficient method for doing or managing something&amp;rdquo; or in the Indian language, we say &lt;em&gt;Jugaad&lt;/em&gt;.

      <title>Epic Pen is great Windows Ink workspace alternative for Windows 7</title>
      <link>https://www.geekyhub.in/post/screen_sketch_older_windows_7/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows Ink workspace is great addition to Windows 10. Due to this tool, annotating has never been easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Windows 7 is still rock solid in the marked. Apart from corporate users many personal users are on Windows 7 which include my relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I use thier PC, only option to achieve the screen sketch is to take screenshot in paint and draw on it using pain. This method is not bad but also doesn&amp;rsquo;t goes smoothly with my work flow. Mainly because it involes too much clicks

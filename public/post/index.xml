      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had my last paper of this semester&amp;rsquo;s exams just a day before yesterday. If I can speak my mind, this semester has been very boring. Most of the subjects were a just compilation of the subjects I have read in previous semesters which made me lukewarm about studies. I am just hopeful that I&amp;rsquo;ll get pass marks in all subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In course of examination, I stumbled upon my lost forgotten blog on &lt;a href=&#34;http://geekyhub.blogspot.in&#34;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;  . It didn&amp;rsquo;t take much time to realize that the blog is very embarrassing, done like a 10 to 5 job. A personal touch cannot be found on that blog. So, I decided to do a fresh start after examinations and this new blog is my another effort.&lt;/p&gt;

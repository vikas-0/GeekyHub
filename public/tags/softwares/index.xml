      <description>Mircosoft&amp;rsquo;s Visual Studio Code has proven to be the dark horse of code editors. Don&amp;rsquo;t confuse yourself by seeing Microsoft as it is completely free, open source and MIT licensed.
Even being late to the party, it has attracted enough users. The reason behind this is a perfect balance between speed, features, and hackability.
If you are new to this editor, these are some features you should be known to improve your productivity.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows Ink workspace is great addition to Windows 10. Due to this tool, annotating has never been easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Windows 7 is still rock solid in the marked. Apart from corporate users many personal users are on Windows 7 which include my relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I use thier PC, only option to achieve the screen sketch is to take screenshot in paint and draw on it using pain. This method is not bad but also doesn&amp;rsquo;t goes smoothly with my work flow. Mainly because it involes too much clicks

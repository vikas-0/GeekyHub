      <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows Ink workspace is great addition to Windows 10. Due to this tool, annotating has never been easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Windows 7 is still rock solid in the marked. Apart from corporate users many personal users are on Windows 7 which include my relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I use thier PC, only option to achieve the screen sketch is to take screenshot in paint and draw on it using pain. This method is not bad but also doesn&amp;rsquo;t goes smoothly with my work flow. Mainly because it involes too much clicks
